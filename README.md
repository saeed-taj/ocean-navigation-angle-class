This project implements a C++ class angle that represents geographic coordinates used in ocean navigation. The class holds latitude and longitude data as degrees, minutes, and direction (N, S, E, W). The application allows the user to input angle values and displays them in a standard nautical format.

Features
Degrees and Minutes: The angle is represented using integer degrees and decimal minutes.
Direction: The direction can be North (N), South (S), East (E), or West (W).
Input and Output: Includes functions to input angles from the user and display them in the format 149°34.8’ W.
Three-Argument Constructor: Initializes an angle with degrees, minutes, and direction.
Example
The input and output format is designed to match the typical coordinates in ocean navigation, like 149°34.8’ W or 17°31.5’ S.

Usage
Compile and run the program.
The program will display a default angle value initialized with the constructor.
The user can then enter new angle values, and the program will display them in the correct format.
How to Run
Clone the repository.
Compile the C++ file with a standard compiler.
Run the executable and follow the prompts to enter angle values.
